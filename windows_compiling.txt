I made this project using VScode on Windows, hence the lack of makefiles. Here is the generic command i used to build it :

nvcc -g <WITH OR WITHOUT -use_fast_math> -I <VCPKG INCLUDE REPOSITORY PATH> -L <VCPKG LIB REPOSITORY PATH> -lgsl -lgslcblas <CU FILE PATH> -o <OUTPUT EXE FILE PATH>

in my case :

nvcc -g <WITH OR WITHOUT -use_fast_math> -I C:\DEV\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include -L C:\DEV\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib -lgsl -lgslcblas C:\Users\t\Desktop\HPC\projet\v3-1.cu -o C:\Users\t\Desktop\HPC\projet\v3-1.exe

Requirements :
- VCPKG has to be installed
- GNU Scientific Library (GSL) has to be installed through VCPKG
- GSL repository has to be added to PATH environment variable
- NVidia CUDA Toolkit repository containing the nvcc compiler has to be added to PATH environment variable
- .vscode configuration folder from source folder can be used to facilitate the build
